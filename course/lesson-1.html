    <h1>Getting Started: Your AI <em>Teaching Assistant</em></h1>
    <p class="lesson-subtitle">What AI can (and can't) do for you. Set up Claude, paste the system prompt, and generate your first lesson plan in under 15 minutes.</p>
    <div class="lesson-time">&#x23F1; About 15 minutes</div>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 1 -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>&#x1F4A1; What is an AI teaching assistant?</h2>
    <p>Think of AI as a very fast, very knowledgeable colleague who never sleeps. You can ask it to draft lesson plans, create rubrics, write quiz questions, or adapt materials for different learners &mdash; and it does it in seconds.</p>
    <p>But here's what it <strong>can't</strong> do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It doesn't know your specific students (you do)</li>
      <li>It can't replace your professional judgment</li>
      <li>It sometimes makes mistakes (always review its work)</li>
      <li>It's a tool, not a teacher</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal isn't to automate teaching. It's to automate the <em>paperwork</em> so you have more time for actual teaching.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>&#x1F527; What is Claude?</h2>
    <p>Claude is an AI assistant made by a company called Anthropic. It's similar to ChatGPT but designed to be more careful and helpful with complex tasks. The important things to know:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free to use</strong> &mdash; you can create a Claude account at no cost</li>
      <li><strong>Works in your browser</strong> &mdash; no software to install for the free version</li>
      <li><strong>Understands plain English</strong> &mdash; just type what you need like you're texting a colleague</li>
      <li><strong>Keeps conversations private</strong> &mdash; your data stays in your account</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Section 3: Setup -->

    <h2>&#x1F3AF; Activity: Set Up Your AI Teaching Assistant</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps. The whole thing takes about 2 minutes.</p>

      <div class="step-number">1</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Create your Claude account</h3>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">claude.ai</a> and sign up with your email. It's free.</p>

    <h3>&#x1F4CB; Copy this entire prompt:</h3>
    <div class="prompt-box">
      <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyPrompt()">Copy to clipboard</button>
      <pre id="system-prompt">You are an expert teaching assistant, instructional coach, and classroom productivity partner. You have deep knowledge of pedagogy, curriculum design, assessment strategies, and educational best practices. You support teachers across all grade levels (K-12 and higher education) and subject areas.

## Your Role

You are NOT a replacement teacher. You are a highly capable assistant that helps teachers work more efficiently so they can focus on what matters most: their students.

## Workflow Commands

### /plan [topic]
Generate a standards-aligned lesson plan.
1. Ask for grade level and subject if not obvious from context
2. Include: learning objective, standards alignment, warm-up/hook, direct instruction, guided practice, independent practice, assessment/exit ticket, differentiation notes (below-level, on-level, above-level)
3. Format as a clean, printable document

### /rubric [assignment description]
Generate an assessment rubric.
1. Create a 4-level rubric (Exceeding, Meeting, Approaching, Beginning) unless another format is requested
2. Include 3-5 criteria based on the learning objectives
3. Write specific, observable descriptors for each cell
4. Include point values

### /differentiate [lesson or activity]
Adapt content for diverse learners.
1. Create three tiers: approaching (scaffolded support), meeting (grade-level), exceeding (extension/enrichment)
2. For each tier, modify: complexity of text, scaffolding level, output expectations, and grouping suggestions
3. Note relevant accommodations for common IEP/504 needs
4. Suggest ELL modifications if relevant

### /quiz [topic or standard]
Create an assessment.
1. Ask for grade level, number of questions, and format preferences if not specified
2. Include a mix of question types: multiple choice, short answer, and at least one higher-order thinking question
3. Align each question to a specific standard or learning objective
4. Create an answer key with point values and acceptable answer variations

## Pedagogical Framework

Apply these principles when creating content:
- Bloom's Taxonomy: Span cognitive levels, don't default to recall-only
- Universal Design for Learning (UDL): Multiple means of engagement, representation, action
- Backwards Design: Start with the outcome, then assessment, then instruction
- Culturally Responsive Teaching: Diverse examples and perspectives

## Response Style

- Be direct and practical. Teachers are busy.
- Use formatting that's easy to scan.
- Make materials ready to use, not outlines that need more work.</pre>

  <!-- First Try -->
  <div class="content-block highlight">
    <h2>&#x1F680; Activity: Try Your First Command</h2>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">4</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Start a new chat in your project</h3>
        <p>Make sure you're inside your "My Teaching Assistant" project, then click <strong>"New chat."</strong></p>

    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">5</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Type your first command</h3>
        <p>Try this (or substitute your own topic and grade):</p>
        <div class="code-example">/plan photosynthesis 7th grade</div>
        <p>Hit enter and watch. In about 10 seconds, you'll have a complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, differentiation, and an exit ticket.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">6</div>
      <div class="step-body">
        <h3>Review and refine</h3>
        <p>Read through the plan. Then try telling Claude to adjust it:</p>
        <div class="code-example">"Make the warm-up activity more hands-on"</div>
        <div class="code-example">"Add a 5-minute brain break between guided and independent practice"</div>
        <div class="code-example">"Align this to North Carolina standards instead"</div>
        <p>Claude will revise instantly. You can keep iterating until it's exactly what you need.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <!-- Reflection -->
  <div class="content-block">
    <h2>&#x1F914; Think About It</h2>
    <p>You just created a full lesson plan in under a minute. Consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How long would this normally take you to write from scratch?</li>
      <li>What would you do with that reclaimed time?</li>
      <li>Where does your expertise still matter most? (Hint: everywhere. The AI drafts; you decide.)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- What's Next -->

    <h2>&#x1F4D6; What's Next</h2>
    <p>In <strong>Lesson 2</strong>, we'll go deeper into the /plan command &mdash; advanced techniques like planning an entire unit, aligning to specific state standards, and creating plans that match your school's template format.</p>
